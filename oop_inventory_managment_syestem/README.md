# 🧾 Inventory Management System (OOP-Based)

This is a simple **Inventory Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **Python**. The system supports adding and managing different types of products such as electronics, groceries and clothing. It also supports persistent data storage using JSON files, allowing product data to be saved and reloaded across sessions.
